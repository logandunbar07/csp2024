    <h3>   Our project was Build A Snowman. We ask the player questions on how they want to build their snowman, and the snowman's festures and accesories. We used if statements in our 
           code to allow players to use the Y and N keys to decide what their snowman will look like. Once you're done building, your final result will appear on top of a background 
           of a ski slope. </h3>

    <h3> Our project that we created was a take on the popular game Frogger. You use the arrow keys to maneuver your minion around the cars in the busy streets and the logs in the wild river.
         Once you get past the obstacles and make it to the finish line, you will recieve a message that says Congratulations! You win! </h3>
