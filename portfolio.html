    <h3>   Our project was Build A Snowman. We ask the player questions on how they want to build their snowman, and the snowman's festures and accesories. We used if statements in our 
           code to allow players to use the Y and N keys to decide what their snowman will look like. Once you're done building, your final result will appear on top of a background 
           of a ski slope. </h3>
